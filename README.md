# Angular application structure template

This application is a template that can be used when writing (large) applications in angularJS 1.5 or higher. It should also be interchangable with angularJS 2.0.

Before writing any code, start by explaining what the application should do, what the goal of the user is and the different domains the application can be devided into. 
After that explain how the application is build:
- What the file structure is and how files should be named.
- What tools and libraries are used, what for and how.
- How the source code is managed in source control.
- What patterns and best practices are used overal in the code.

And finally explain how the application should be set up so it can be run locally by a developer or on a remote server.
